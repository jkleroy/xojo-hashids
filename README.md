# xojo-hashids
Hashids, ported for XOJO (http://www.hashids.org)


# DESCRIPTION

This is a port of the Hashids JavaScript library for VBA.

Hashids was designed for use in URL shortening, tracking stuff,
validating accounts or making pages private (through abstraction.)
Instead of showing items as `1`, `2`, or `3`, you could show them as
`b9iLXiAa`, `EATedTBy`, and `Aaco9cy5`.  Hashes depend on your salt
value.
